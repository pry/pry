* alias_command method now much more powerful, e.g: alias_command "lM", "ls -M"
* `whereami` is now more intelligent, automatically showing entire sourcecode of current method if current context is a method (thanks robgleeson).

    monkeypatching methods without touching the original file
* edit-method can now edit REPL-defined methods
* cat --ex now works on exceptions in REPL-defined code
* play -m now uses eval_string.replace()
* play -m --open uses show-input to show play'd code

* new option Pry.config.exception_window_size determines window size for cat --ex
* input_stack now implemented - pushing objects onto a pry instance's input_stack causes the instance to read from those objects in turn as it encounters EOF on the previous object.

MAJOR NEW FEATURES:
- JRuby support, including show-method/edit-method and editor integration on both 1.8 and 1.9 versions

- 'edit' (entered by itself) now opens current lines in input buffer in an editor, and evals on exit
- 'edit' command is also, in general more intelligent
- ls output no longer in array format, and colors can be configured, e.g: Pry.config.ls.ivar_color = :bright_blue
- new switch-to command for moving around the binding stack without exiting out of sessions
- more sophisticated prompts, Pry::NAV_PROMPT to ease deep spelunking of code
- major bug fix for windows systems
- much better support for huge objects, should no longer hang pry (see #245)
- cat --ex and edit --ex now work better

complete CHANGELOG:

* fix history saving (should not save all of Readline::HISTORY, but only what changed)

* 'cd ..' just pops a binding off the binding_stack with special behaviour when only one binding in stack - it breaks out of the repl loop
* added switch-to command (like jump-to but doesnt unwind the stack)
* show-method and show-doc now accept multiple method names
* control_d hook added (Pry.config.control_d_handler)
* behaviour of ^d is now to break out of current expr if in multi-line expr, or break out of current context if nested, or break out of pry repl loop if at top-level

* ^C no longer captured
* got rid of Pry.active_instance, Pry.last_exception and friends.
* also special locals now shared among bindings in a pry instance (i.e _ex_ (and friends) re-injected into new binding entered with 'cd')
* renamed inp and out to _in_ and _out_ (to avoid collisions with actual locals in debugging scope)
* added third parameter to prompts, the pry instance itself (_pry) see https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/233 for why it's important
* cd behaviour when no args performs the same as `cd /`
* commands with keep_retval can now return nil (to suppress output now return 'void' instead)
* Pry::CommandProcessor::Result introduced
* Pry.view_clip() modified to be more robust and properly display Class#name
* edit command when invoked with no args now works like edit -t
* when edit is invoked (with no args or with -t) inside a multi-line expression input buffer, it dumps that buffer into a temp file and takes you to it
* got rid of Pry#null_input? since all that was needed was eval_string.empty?
* cd command now supports complex syntax: cd ../@y/y/../z
* JRuby is no longer a 2nd class citizen, almost full JRuby support, passing 100% tests

* _pry_ now passed as 3rd parameter to :before_session hook
* ls colors now configurable via Pry.config.ls.local_var_color = :bright_red etc
* ls separator configurable via, e.g Pry.config.ls.separator = "  "
* Pry.view_clip() now only calls inspect on a few immediates, otherwise uses the #<> syntax, which has been truncated further to exclude teh mem address, again related to #245

27/7/2011 version 0.9.3
* cat --ex (cats 5 lines above and below line in file where exception was raised)
* edit --ex (edits line in file where exception was raised)
* edit -t (opens a temporary file and evals it in current context when closed)
* `pry -r` requires now happen after plugin loading (so as not to interfere with
* new Pry.config.disable_auto_reload option, for turning off auto reloading by edit-method and related (thanks ryanf)
* add better error messages for `cd` command
* fixed exotic object regression - BasicObject.new etc now return "=> unknown"

* Pry.config.command_prefix support (thanks ryanf!)
* fixed indentation for simple-prompt
* hist command now excludes last line of input (the command invocation itself)
* hist now has `history` alias
