20/01/2012 version 0.9.11.4

* added Pry.last_internal_error, useful for devs debugging commands

17/01/2012 version 0.9.11.3
* fix Pry.run_command
* improve `ls` output
* add :requires_gem => "jist" to 'gist' command (so deps can be installed
	via install-command)
* improve help for 'edit' command

16/01/2012 version 0.9.11.2
* minor bug fix for gist on windows, rescuing Jist::ClipboardError
rather than letting the scary error spill out to users and potentially
have them think the gist didnt post.

16/01/2012 version 0.9.11.1
* fixed minor bug in 'gist' command where i neglected to remove
  a call to a non-existent method (no_arg) which was called when
  `gist` is invoked with no parameters

16/01/2013 version 0.9.11
dependency changes:
* upgrade the slop gem to version ~> 3.4
* new optional dependency: Bond (you'll need to perform `gem install bond`). It enables autocompletion if you use Readline. Does not support work for Editline (more info: https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/FAQ#wiki-readline). Big thanks to cldwalker.

new features:
* #738 basic Ruby 2.0 support
* #732 JRuby 1.7.0+ support
* new reload-code command, using it you can reload code for methods,
	classes, commands, objects and so on. e.g reload-code MyCLass,
	reload-code my_method, reload-code my_obj
* added bond tabcompletion, much more powerful than standard tab
	completion. However, it requires a real 'readline' to work,
	so will not work on standard osx setup (since it uses Editline)
* show-source can now extract source for classes, methods, procs,
	pry commands, and arbitrary objects (it shows the source for the class of
	the object). As a result, show-command is now deprecated
* gist/play/save-file now infer object type without requiring flags,
	e.g play MyClass, play my_file.rb, play my_method
* edit command can now edit most things, including: files, methods,
	classes, commands. As a result the 'edit-method' command is now
	deprecatd.
	e.g edit my_file.rb, edit my_method, edit MyClass
* removed "edit-method", now merged with 'edit'
* amend-line and play now properly indent code added to input buffer.

* edit-method can now edit REPL-defined methods
* cat --ex now works on exceptions in REPL-defined code
* play -m now uses eval_string.replace()
* play -m --open uses show-input to show play'd code

* input_stack now implemented - pushing objects onto a pry instance's input_stack causes the instance to read from those objects in turn as it encounters EOF on the previous object.

- 'edit' (entered by itself) now opens current lines in input buffer in an editor, and evals on exit
- 'edit' command is also, in general more intelligent
- ls output no longer in array format, and colors can be configured, e.g: Pry.config.ls.ivar_color = :bright_blue
- new switch-to command for moving around the binding stack without exiting out of sessions
- more sophisticated prompts, Pry::NAV_PROMPT to ease deep spelunking of code
- major bug fix for windows systems

* 'cd ..' just pops a binding off the binding_stack with special behaviour when only one binding in stack - it breaks out of the repl loop
* added switch-to command (like jump-to but doesnt unwind the stack)
* show-method and show-doc now accept multiple method names
* control_d hook added (Pry.config.control_d_handler)
* behaviour of ^d is now to break out of current expr if in multi-line expr, or break out of current context if nested, or break out of pry repl loop if at top-level

* ^C no longer captured
* got rid of Pry.active_instance, Pry.last_exception and friends.
* also special locals now shared among bindings in a pry instance (i.e _ex_ (and friends) re-injected into new binding entered with 'cd')
* renamed inp and out to _in_ and _out_ (to avoid collisions with actual locals in debugging scope)
* added third parameter to prompts, the pry instance itself (_pry) see https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/233 for why it's important
* cd behaviour when no args performs the same as `cd /`
* commands with keep_retval can now return nil (to suppress output now return 'void' instead)
* Pry::CommandProcessor::Result introduced
* Pry.view_clip() modified to be more robust and properly display Class#name
* edit command when invoked with no args now works like edit -t
* when edit is invoked (with no args or with -t) inside a multi-line expression input buffer, it dumps that buffer into a temp file and takes you to it
* got rid of Pry#null_input? since all that was needed was eval_string.empty?
* cd command now supports complex syntax: cd ../@y/y/../z
* JRuby is no longer a 2nd class citizen, almost full JRuby support, passing 100% tests

* _pry_ now passed as 3rd parameter to :before_session hook
* ls colors now configurable via Pry.config.ls.local_var_color = :bright_red etc
* ls separator configurable via, e.g Pry.config.ls.separator = "  "
* Pry.view_clip() now only calls inspect on a few immediates, otherwise uses the #<> syntax, which has been truncated further to exclude teh mem address, again related to #245

27/7/2011 version 0.9.3
* cat --ex (cats 5 lines above and below line in file where exception was raised)
* edit --ex (edits line in file where exception was raised)
* edit -t (opens a temporary file and evals it in current context when closed)
* `pry -r` requires now happen after plugin loading (so as not to interfere with
* new Pry.config.disable_auto_reload option, for turning off auto reloading by edit-method and related (thanks ryanf)
* add better error messages for `cd` command
* fixed exotic object regression - BasicObject.new etc now return "=> unknown"
* added reload-method command (reloads the associated file of a method)
* converted: import => import-set, version => pry-version, install => install-command
* Pry.config.command_prefix support (thanks ryanf!)
* fixed indentation for simple-prompt
* hist command now excludes last line of input (the command invocation itself)
